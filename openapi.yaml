    Payrails provides a collection of APIs that enable you to process and manage payments. Our APIs accept and return JSON in the HTTP body, and return standard HTTP response codes. You can consume the APIs directly using your favorite HTTP/REST library.

      Payrails API supports idempotency. That means that you can safely retry requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. This is key for any financial operation, and especially useful when an API call is disrupted in transit, and you don't get a response in time.

      For performing idempotent requests, you need to add the `x-idempotency-key` header. Operations that require an idempotency key, will return a `request.idempotency-key.missing` error if you don't include the specific header. A `request.idempotency-key.not-uuid` will be returned if an invalid UUID is passed as a value. An idempotency key is a unique value generated by the client which the server uses to recognize subsequent retries of the same request. Payrails uses V4 UUIDs as it brings enough entropy to avoid collisions.

        Retrieve an access token to authenticate your requests to Payrails' services.

        The access token will be valid for a limited duration indicated by the `expires_in` field in the response.

        You should store the token on your side until it expires, at which point you will need to obtain a new one by making a new request.
